I'm a self taught junior full stack developer. I never thought about becoming a developer until I tried some CSS to fix a Wordpress site I was working on. I always thought it looked like gibberish until I sat down and read about CSS. Upon learning the basics in a day, I thought well, this isn't as difficult as I thought. So I looked at learning JavaScript. Slowly but surely, I finally discovered what I wanted to do in life, and love learning about coding.<br><br>I'm currently looking to break into a development role, so if you could use a quick learning, self-motivated full stack developer;<br><a class="blue-font" href="mailto:rkhalid@me.com">get in touch</a> :D.</p><h3 class="skills secondary-title">Some skills that I've picked up so far</h3><div class="tech"><ul><li>HTML</li><li>CSS</li><li>SCSS</li><li>JavaScript</li><li>TypeScript</li><li>jQuery</li><li>Node JS</li><li>Express JS</li><li>EJS</li><li>React JS</li><li>Gulp JS</li><li>SQL</li><li>Mongo DB</li><li>Python</li><li>Git</li><li>Command Line</li><li>Wordpress</li></ul></div></div><hr><div class="projects"><h3 class="secondary-title">Some projects that I've been working on</h3><div class="project"><div class="video"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3_LY-xE1iJk?rel=0" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><div class="description"><h5>To do List React SPA</h5><p>A simple to do list utility Single Page Application. You can add and delete to dos and mark them as done. There is an error check for an empty field being submitted. The app was made initially using class based components and then refactored to use React hooks. The version that uses hooks is saved on a separate branch.</p><h6>Technologies used:</h6><p><strong>React</strong> (create-react-app), <strong>Emotion</strong> for styling.</p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RayKay91/reactTodoApp">Look at the Github repo</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://raykay91-todo-app.netlify.app">Visit Website</a></div></div><div class="project"><div class="video"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6D1xRFKB3oI?rel=0" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><div class="description"><h5>Blog</h5><p>An MVC based blog website with data persistence and CRUD capabilities.

It has a working clock, conditional highlighting based on the current prayer time, and native notifications for when the next prayer time starts. This was my first ever project so the codebase isn't the cleanest but I learned a lot from it, expecially the value of scalability and why organisation is key in a code base. Initially the data (times) was manually inserted and accessed via normal Javascript object handling syntax. This was recently changed to scrape the times from the website using axios to 'GET' the page, and an npm package called cheerio to select the elements needed. The web scraping version is saved on a separate branch.</p><h6>Technologies used:</h6><p><strong>Electron JS</strong>, <strong>web-scraping</strong> (used axios and cheerio to build a Node JS based web scraper).</p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RayKay91/prayerTimetable">Look at the Github repo</a></div></div><div class="project"><div class="video"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/raLuMTkvrwo?rel=0" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><div class="description"><h5>Weather checker app</h5><p>A super simple app that shows the current weather in a particular location, and a small icon of the description of the weather.
