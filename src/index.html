      <p>
        Hey there. I'm a self taught junior full stack developer. From a young
        age I've loved puzzles and love solving them. It wasn't until I tried
        coding that I realised that puzzles and coding are not too dissimilar.
        Both require analysis of problems, thinking about them and what's
        keeping the solution out of reach, solving a path to the solution and
        cracking the code (pun intended). My passion for this, and seeing the
        awesome capabilities that knowing how to code gives you, meant that I
        really wanted to pursue this as a career path.
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm currently looking to break into a development role, so if you could
        use a quick learning, self-motivated full stack developer; <br />
        <a class="blue-font" href="mailto:rkhalid@me.com">get in touch</a>
        :D.

          <h5>Freelance company website</h5>
          <p>
            A project I was commissioned for. The client wanted a logo, brand identity, a website design and development.
          </p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Brief:</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>A clear professional logo that conveys what we do. Professional branding. A fast and responsive website with a clear message and strong SEO. Live chat feature required. Some animation on the website. Require two forms.</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>Based upon this brief I made a brand identity consisting of clear and easy to ready fonts, and a limited colour palette consisting mainly of blue and various shades of it to envoke feelings of professionalism and trustworthiness. In the logo, I used a bold deep blue for the initials of the business with sharp lines and edges and I coloured the arrow red with a subtle gradient to provide visual interest and a sense of movement.</p>
            <p>I chose Gatsby JS to create the website for its speed, and image optimisation abilities. Client side routing enables for a really fast and snappy feel to the website. Gatsby's image optimisation feature uses GraphQL to query the images and Gatsby takes care of creating a variety of sizes and automatically provides the optimised image at the correct viewport size. Due to the static nature and speed of the website it allows for great SEO. For the animation I used React Framer Motion due to to its simplicity in creating simple animations. Netlify was chosen as the CDN due to its great developer experience and ease of use as well as its speed.</p>

        <h5>Mobile Timetable App</h5>
        <p>
        A cross platform mobile app which obtains data for the times of prayer for a local mosque. To avoid unneccessary scraping of the website I created a custom API using Node and Express JS to scrape the times, and store them in a JSON file. If a request comes on the same date the file contents are presented as the API data, if the date of request is different to the date on which the scraping occured, the scraper is sent out to ge fresh times and the user is served those instead. A new Twitter API was used to gain access to the latest tweets of the user and present them in the app also.

          A responsive website for a mexican eatery I actually owned. The
          website is almost exactly the same as when it was open, but back
          then it was made with Wix, now it's been made from scratch using
          HTML and CSS rather than dragging and dropping.

          <p>
            A simple to do list utility Single Page Application. You can add and
            delete to dos and mark them as done. There is an error check for an
            empty field being submitted. The app was made initially using class
            based components and then refactored to use React hooks. The version
            that uses hooks is saved on a separate branch. The branch that uses hooks has also been updated to use Redux for state management. Overkill? Sure. But I did it to practice what I had learnt from Redux and to practice integrating it into an app without global state management.

          <h5>Prayer Timetable app</h5>
          <p>
            A cross platform (MacOS, Windows, Linux) desktop app, made for a
            local mosque. It has a working clock, conditional highlighting based
            on the current prayer time, and native notifications for when the
            next prayer time starts. This was my first ever project so the
            codebase isn't the cleanest but I learned a lot from it, expecially
            the value of scalability and why organisation is key in a code base.
            Initially the data (times) was manually inserted and accessed via
            normal Javascript object handling syntax. This was recently changed
            to scrape the times from the website using axios to 'GET' the page,
            and an npm package called cheerio to select the elements needed. The
            web scraping version is saved on a separate branch.
